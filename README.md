# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: a missing `return` statement in a page component.

Next.js 15 requires that all page components return a React element.  If a component is missing a `return` statement (or returns `undefined` implicitly), Next.js will throw an error.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will see an error in the browser console.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.

## Solution

The solution is simple: add a `return` statement to the `About` component, returning a React element.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.

## Additional Notes

This error can be tricky to debug because the error message might not directly point to the missing `return` statement.  Always make sure your page components have an explicit `return` statement.
